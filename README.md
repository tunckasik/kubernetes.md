# Welcome to my Kubernetes Repository
This repository contains a collection of projects and hands-on exercises that I have worked on to gain expertise in Kubernetes. I have used Kubernetes to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications, and I have experience working with various Kubernetes components, including pods, services, deployments, and configmaps.
